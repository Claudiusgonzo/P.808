# It specifies a rule on how to get the condition name/number from each file name, using this pattern:
# 'x' means to neglect the character in filename on that position
# '?' means to keep the character in filename on that position
# example: Assuming "F1_M2_C01.wav" is a file name,and "C01" is the condition name. The patter will be "xxxxxx???xxxx"
# comment it when no condition level aggregation is needed
condition_pattern: xxxxxx??xxxx
